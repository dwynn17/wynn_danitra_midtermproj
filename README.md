# Association Rule Mining with Brute Force and Apriori Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of Association Rule Mining using Brute Force Method (Part 2) and Apriori Algorithm Comparison (Part 3). The goal is to compare the efficiency and performance of these two approaches.

## Installation

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

1. Install pandas:  
   ```pip install pandas```

2. Install mlxtend (used for the Apriori algorithm):
   ```pip install mlxtend```



## Part 2: Brute Force Association Rule Mining
   ```python brute_force_association.py```



## Part 3: Brute Force vs Apriori Comparison
   ```python brute_force_apriori_comparison.py```
